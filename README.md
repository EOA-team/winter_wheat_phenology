# Simulation of winter wheat heading dates using WOFOST-PHENOLOGY for two Swiss varieties

This repository contains code and data to simulate heading dates of Swiss varieties for nearly five decades (1971 to 2020) in the main wheat production areas of Switzerland.

## Setup the environment

Clone the repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone <URL>
cd wofost_phenology
```

Create a Python environment and install the dependencies (shown for Linux systems).

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the simulation
